What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff\u2014I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them.\"\n* Holden's struggle to connect with others is evident in: \"I'm sick of not having anybody to talk to.

It's trained on a massive dataset of code from various programming languages and is intended to assist developers with coding-related tasks.\n\nLlama 3, on the other hand, is a more general-purpose conversational AI model, designed to engage in natural-sounding conversations, answer questions, and provide information on a wide range of topics. It's trained on a massive dataset of text from various sources, including books, articles, and online conversations.\n\nWhile both models are based on the same transformer architecture, they differ in their training data, objectives, and use cases. CodeLlama is optimized for coding tasks, whereas Llama 3 is designed for more general conversational tasks.[/INST]</s></s>\n<s>[INST]Can you remember our last conversation and please be super brief on your answer?[/INST]\nAssistant : <s>[INST]We discussed the capital of Scotland (Edinburgh) and the difference between CodeLlama and Llama 3 AI models.[/INST]</s></s>\n"}
